# Cache Simulation System
    **Date:** 2024  
    **Tools:** C/C++ (or Python), Make

    ## Overview
    Configurable levels (L1/L2), associativity, line size, and replacement policy.

    ## Features
    - Configurable levels (L1/L2), associativity, line size, and replacement policy.
- Tracks hits, misses, evictions, and average memory access time (AMAT).
- Includes parsers for trace inputs and report generation.

    ## How to Run
    - See the `src/` folder for source files and `tests/` (if present) for testbenches or unit tests.
    - Add your actual code, inputs, and screenshots as you iterate.
    - Keep commits atomic with descriptive messages (e.g., *"Implement delete() and fix traversal bug"*).

    ## What I Learned
    Impact of associativity and replacement on hit rate; interpreting AMAT.
