# Vending Machine Simulator (Java)
    **Date:** 2024  
    **Tools:** Python

    ## Overview
    Finite-state machine for selection, payment, dispense, and change return.

    ## Features
    - Finite-state machine for selection, payment, dispense, and change return.
- Unit tests for state transitions and error handling.
- CLI runner for interactive simulation.

    ## How to Run
    - See the `src/` folder for source files and `tests/` (if present) for testbenches or unit tests.
    - Add your actual code, inputs, and screenshots as you iterate.
    - Keep commits atomic with descriptive messages (e.g., *"Implement delete() and fix traversal bug"*).

    ## What I Learned
    Modeling with states/events; clean separation of UI from logic.
