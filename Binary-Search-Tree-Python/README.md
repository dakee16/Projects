# Binary Search Tree (Python)
    **Date:** Mar 2024  
    **Tools:** Python 3.x

    ## Overview
    Implemented BST insert, search, and delete.

    ## Features
    - Implemented BST insert, search, and delete.
- Added recursive and iterative traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder, level-order).
- Simple visualization and basic performance instrumentation.

    ## How to Run
    - See the `src/` folder for source files and `tests/` (if present) for testbenches or unit tests.
    - Add your actual code, inputs, and screenshots as you iterate.
    - Keep commits atomic with descriptive messages (e.g., *"Implement delete() and fix traversal bug"*).

    ## What I Learned
    Trade-offs between recursive and iterative implementations; height-balanced trees vs. plain BSTs.
