# PipelineCPU (Verilog, Vivado on Zybo board)
    **Date:** 2024–2025  
    **Tools:** Verilog, Vivado, Zybo Board

    ## Overview
    Multi-stage pipelined CPU with hazard detection and forwarding.

    ## Features
    - Multi-stage pipelined CPU with hazard detection and forwarding.
- Implements control path, datapath, and basic instruction set subset.
- Includes testbenches and simulation waveforms.

    ## How to Run
    - See the `src/` folder for source files and `tests/` (if present) for testbenches or unit tests.
    - Add your actual code, inputs, and screenshots as you iterate.
    - Keep commits atomic with descriptive messages (e.g., *"Implement delete() and fix traversal bug"*).

    ## What I Learned
    Pipeline hazards, forwarding logic, and timing closure on FPGA targets.
