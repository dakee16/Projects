# Digital Logic Design Labs (CMPEN 270)
    **Date:** May 2025  
    **Tools:** Verilog, Vivado, Zybo Board

    ## Overview
    Designed and simulated combinational and sequential circuits.

    ## Features
    - Designed and simulated combinational and sequential circuits.
- ALU design and register file integration.
- Finite State Machines (FSMs) with optimized timing and area.
- Synthesis, simulation, and timing analysis using Xilinx Vivado.

    ## How to Run
    - See the `src/` folder for source files and `tests/` (if present) for testbenches or unit tests.
    - Add your actual code, inputs, and screenshots as you iterate.
    - Keep commits atomic with descriptive messages (e.g., *"Implement delete() and fix traversal bug"*).

    ## What I Learned
    Hands-on FPGA flow: writing Verilog, testbenches, synthesis, implementation, and debugging on hardware.
