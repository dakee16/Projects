# Matrix & Determinant Simulator (Python)
    **Date:** 2024  
    **Tools:** Python 3.x, NumPy (optional)

    ## Overview
    Computes determinants, inverses, and common matrix operations.

    ## Features
    - Computes determinants, inverses, and common matrix operations.
- Step-by-step mode to show intermediate elimination steps.
- Optional NumPy acceleration with a pure-Python fallback.

    ## How to Run
    - See the `src/` folder for source files and `tests/` (if present) for testbenches or unit tests.
    - Add your actual code, inputs, and screenshots as you iterate.
    - Keep commits atomic with descriptive messages (e.g., *"Implement delete() and fix traversal bug"*).

    ## What I Learned
    Numerical stability, Gaussian elimination, and the cost of matrix operations.
