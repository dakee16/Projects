# Course Scheduler (Java + SQL)
    **Date:** 2024–2025  
    **Tools:** Java 17, JDBC, SQL (SQLite/MySQL)

    ## Overview
    Models courses, prerequisites, sections, and student schedules.

    ## Features
    - Models courses, prerequisites, sections, and student schedules.
- Detects conflicts (time overlaps, prerequisites, credit overload).
- DAO layer with SQL schema and sample seed data.

    ## How to Run
    - See the `src/` folder for source files and `tests/` (if present) for testbenches or unit tests.
    - Add your actual code, inputs, and screenshots as you iterate.
    - Keep commits atomic with descriptive messages (e.g., *"Implement delete() and fix traversal bug"*).

    ## What I Learned
    Separation of concerns (models/DAO/services), schema design, and transaction-safe updates.
