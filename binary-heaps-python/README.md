# Working with Binary Heaps (Python)

    **When:** Nov 2025  
    **Stack:** Python 3 (standard library)

    ## Overview
    Implements both min-heap and max-heap with heapify; includes a tiny priority-queue demo.

    ## How to run
    ```bash
    python heaps.py --demo
    ```

    ## What I learned
    - Heapify from array (O(n))
- Push/pop (O(log n))
- Priority queue use-cases
