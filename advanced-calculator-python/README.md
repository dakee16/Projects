# Advanced Calculator (Python)

    **When:** Nov 2025  
    **Stack:** Python 3 (standard library)

    ## Overview
    Calculator implemented using stacks and queues (Shunting-Yard) supporting algebraic expressions; includes a simple polynomial evaluator.

    ## How to run
    ```bash
    python calc.py --expr "3 + 4 * (2 - 1)"
    python calc.py --poly "2x^2 + 3x - 5" --x 4
    ```

    ## What I learned
    - Stack/queue data structures for expression parsing
- Infix → RPN (Shunting-Yard)
- Basic polynomial parsing/evaluation
